# Smart Campus Operations Hub 🏫

**IT3030 – Programming Applications and Frameworks**  
**Assignment 2026 (Semester 2)**  
**Faculty of Computing – SLIIT**


## 📋 Project Overview

A complete, production-inspired web system for university facility and asset management. This platform modernizes day-to-day campus operations by providing a single integrated platform for **resource booking**, **maintenance tracking**, and **incident handling** with role-based access control and full auditability.

### Business Scenario
A university needs a web platform to:
- Manage facility and asset bookings (rooms, labs, equipment)
- Handle maintenance and incident reports with technician workflow
- Support clear workflows with role-based access
- Provide real-time notifications and audit trails

---

## ✨ Core Features (Modules A–E)

### Module A – Facilities & Assets Catalogue
- **Catalogue Management**: Maintain a comprehensive catalogue of bookable resources
  - Types: Lecture Halls, Labs, Meeting Rooms, Equipment (projectors, cameras, etc.)
  - Metadata: Capacity, location, availability windows, status (`ACTIVE` / `OUT_OF_SERVICE`)
- **Search & Filtering**: Filter by type, capacity, and location with real-time search
- **Status Tracking**: Live visibility of resource availability

### Module B – Booking Management
- **Booking Workflow**: `PENDING` → `APPROVED`/`REJECTED` → `CANCELLED` (optional)
- **Conflict Prevention**: Automatic detection of overlapping time ranges
- **Approval System**: Admin review and approval/rejection with custom reasons
- **User Views**: 
  - Users see only their own bookings
  - Admins see all bookings with filtering capabilities

### Module C – Maintenance & Incident Ticketing
- **Ticket Creation**: Users can report incidents with category, description, and priority
- **Attachments**: Support up to 3 image attachments per ticket (evidence documentation)
- **Ticket Workflow**: `OPEN` → `IN_PROGRESS` → `RESOLVED` → `CLOSED` (Admin may set `REJECTED`)
- **Technician Assignment**: Staff can be assigned to tickets with status updates and resolution notes
- **Comments System**: Multi-user commenting with ownership rules (edit/delete own comments only)

### Module D – Notifications
- **Notification Events**: 
  - Booking approval/rejection
  - Ticket status changes
  - New comments on user's tickets
- **UI Access**: Notification panel in the web interface

### Module E – Authentication & Authorization
- **OAuth 2.0 Login**: Google sign-in integration
- **Role-Based Access Control**:
  - `USER`: Regular students/staff
  - `ADMIN`: Resource and booking management
  - `TECHNICIAN`: Ticket assignment and resolution (optional enhancement)
- **Secured Endpoints**: All endpoints protected by role-based authorization
